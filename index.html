    <h1 style="font-family:Calibri Light">I am an undergraduate student at Yale university. I got involved with an older guy that works for #yaleunions. While we were seeing each other, he started an affair with a faculty member, Dr. ElenaTejGrewal of @yaleenvironment, who to my knowledge is still working at Yale and is going to finish the semester, despite my reporting this.
